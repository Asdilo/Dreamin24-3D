# Demo Components: Designing Interactive 3D Experiences for Salesforce - Dreamin 2024
Thank you for attending my session at Dreamin' In Color 2024. Here's the [link to the session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MBjBkVCt1PLpcL16IFFPzF7AKu6GWIvfETp-MQGfTvU/edit?usp=sharing). This repo contains a Salesforce DX project with the components I demonstrated during our session. 

##Here's what you will find in this project
- Custom 3D Asset Object
- Custom Object Record Page
- Custom 3D Viewer LWC
- 3D Viewer Flow is used for the Record Page dynamic object embeds.

Thanks for attending, and I hope you make some 3D design magic!


Below are the standard Salesforce DX project details. I left them in case you need guidance.

# Salesforce DX Project: Next Steps

Now that you’ve created a Salesforce DX project, what’s next? Here are some documentation resources to get you started.

## How Do You Plan to Deploy Your Changes?

Do you want to deploy a set of changes, or create a self-contained application? Choose a [development model](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/user-guide/development-models).

## Configure Your Salesforce DX Project

The `sfdx-project.json` file contains useful configuration information for your project. See [Salesforce DX Project Configuration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_config.htm) in the _Salesforce DX Developer Guide_ for details about this file.
